## Glass Artist

I've been learning to become a glassblower and flameworker since my friend Sam
got married in a glass studio... and now I guess I'm actually a glass artist?

I even started [selling](https://daniellelancashire.com) some of my functional
work after having pretty good success at christmas markets.

I'm... really proud of some of the work I've been making and I love it.

## Computers

I'm in the process of joining Akamai after [an
acquisition](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/fermyon-joins-akamai). After doing a
lot of the architecture and design work for our Functions service, including
[some optimizations for team
size](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/sqlite-is-edge-scale) it's exciting to think
about how we'll evolve the platform as we continue to grow.

I've otherwise pulled back from a lot of open source to make time for my
artistic pursuits, but I'm still involved in the platform steering group for the
Swift Programming Language, and the Kubernetes code of conduct committee.

## Photography

I've been travelling less now that the world feels smaller and smaller with
every passing week, so photography has taken a back seat. I'd like to try and
make some time to be in the mountains next summer though.
